# rgbledmatrix_32x64_hackstuph

Some fun I was having with an Adafruit 64x32 RGBLED Matrix on an Arduino Mega 2560

You will need this library from Adafruit as well:

Be careful of the orientation of the cable when wiring.  If it doesn't work, flip the ribbon cable over and try the same wiring scheme on the opposite orientation (happened to me twice)
